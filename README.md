# GHC 2022: Demystifying Data Engineering

## Goals
The goal of this workshop is to demystify data engineering and demonstrate some of the important concepts and principles of data engineering via a toy data pipeline. 

Most data engineering workflows make use of cloud computing services and
cloud data warehouses such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and Snowflake, but this demo
won't touch on those, since it's set up to run locally.

This repo contains a pipeline that scrapes the ticker price of a company from Yahoo Finance, along with information about the company from Wikipedia, and generate a simple report. 

## Setup

1. clone the repo
2. change paths in airflow/airflow.cfg to where ever you've chosen to clone the repo
3. activate the venv
4. run airflow standalone
record the password shown in the terminal

### Running

Access the UI at localhost: 8080
Turn the Dag on
